I used these perl scripts to geneate a gallery of photos, and videos
based on webshow which generates the photo gallery, i have modified it to be a bootstrap website generated
I also have webshowvideos which generates a gallery of screenshots which should open a html5 player (browser dependent)
I also have webshowjplayer and webshowjwplayer which generates a page from a filelist to play the videos in a page using the jplayer(www.jplayer.org) and jwplayer (www.jwplayer.com) from longtail


Todo
----
Less hardcoding of the html...
More configuration/conditionals to determine what you want in the menu items
and specifying if you want mp4, ogv or webm formats

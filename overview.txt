I used these perl scripts to geneate a gallery of photos, and videos
based on webshow which generates the photo gallery, i have modified it to be a bootstrap website generated
I also have webshowvideos which generates a gallery of screenshots which should open a html5 player (browser dependent)
I also have webshowjplayer and webshowjwplayer which generates a page from a filelist to play the videos in a page using the jplayer(www.jplayer.org) and jwplayer (www.jwplayer.com) from longtail

You need bootstrap downloaded and stored in js and css directories
You need the JPlayer downloaded and the skin you use
You need the JWPlayer downloaded and stored on your server

Todo
----
Less hardcoding of the html...
More configuration/conditionals to determine what you want in the menu items
and specifying if you want mp4, ogv or webm formats
use sections to break up video gallery into sections/categories
modify videoscript to handle audio/podcasts
modify videoscript  for players to handle youtube hosted videos
